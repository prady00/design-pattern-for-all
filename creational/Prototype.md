Prototype
=============


Real world example
> Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning

In plain words
> Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

Wikipedia says
> The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.

**Programmatic Example**

In PHP, it can be easily done using `clone`

```php
class Sheep
{
    protected $name;
    protected $category;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $category = 'Mountain Sheep')
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->category = $category;
    }

    public function setName(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setCategory(string $category)
    {
        $this->category = $category;
    }

    public function getCategory()
    {
        return $this->category;
    }
}
```
Then it can be cloned like below
```php
$original = new Sheep('Jolly');
echo $original->getName(); // Jolly
echo $original->getCategory(); // Mountain Sheep

// Clone and modify what is required
$cloned = clone $original;
$cloned->setName('Dolly');
echo $cloned->getName(); // Dolly
echo $cloned->getCategory(); // Mountain sheep
```

Also you could use the magic method `__clone` to modify the cloning behavior.

**When to use?**

When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.
